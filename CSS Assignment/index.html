                    I really think that Iceland is the perfect destination for a road trip. In the span of 6 hours you will see beaches, glaciers, mountains, waterfalls, grazing lands….It’s like driving the length of the United States in 1/10th of the time! But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>

                    <p>Iceland? What made you want to go to Iceland? If I had a nickel for every time someone asked me why I wanted to go to Iceland. “Isn’t it cold?!” “What is there to do in Iceland?” To which I can only say: Have you seen pictures of Iceland?! It’s always been on the list of places I wanted to visit, and I can pin the beginning of my fascination to 2 images: This photo of Blue Lagoon and this photo of a canyon. The locations are so unique, I just knew I needed to see it for myself.</p>

                    <p>Of course, Iceland’s frequent use as a filming location in movies/television (especially all of my favorites) also played a huge role in me wanting to go.

                <p class="post-summary">This Indian food guide is a cheat sheet for Indian restaurant menus. It covers the most popular Indian dishes — what they are, how they’re served & more!</p>

                    <p>
                        I love Indian food. All Indian food. However, when I ask people what their favorite Indian dish is, the answer more often than not is “chicken tikka masala.” 
                        
                        This has always bothered me a bit. Now, don’t get me wrong, chicken tikka masala is AMAZING! 
                        
                        In fact, if I had to pick one Indian dish with which to introduce someone to the cuisine, it would probably be chicken tikka masala. But there is so much more to Indian food!
                        
                        The more I questioned people, the more I found out that it wasn’t that they didn’t like other Indian dishes. They simply felt intimidated by the names and did not understand them.  The irony here is that Indian food names are quite simple.  The dishes are usually named after the main components or where they come from. But given that fact, if I did not understand the language, I’d be confused too.
                        
                        Consider this my effort to make things right. Here’s a rundown of what you commonly find on a typical Indian restaurant menu. Now next time when you go to your favorite Indian restaurant to enjoy a meal, use this guide to the most popular Indian dishes and order something outside of your comfort zone. There’s a good chance you’ll be surprised to learn how much goodness you were missing out on!
                        
                        If you would like to enjoy Indian food at home, take a look at our variety of products, such as our curry sauces — a delicious shortcut way to make amazing curries in just 15 minutes! Purchase online, or find our products in a store near you.</p>

                    <p>Building on the success of these campaigns, Mirchi Mumbai, in association with the Indian Navy, proudly announces "Mirchi on the Ocean," a special broadcast event taking place on World Ocean Day, June 8th. For the first time, Mirchi will be broadcasting live from a Navy warship, offering listeners an exclusive experience from the heart of the ocean. As part of this unique event, Mirchi has set up a temporary studio aboard the warship, where our hosts will conduct live shows throughout the day, featuring conversations with Navy officers. Highlighting some of the notable participants in this event, listeners will have the privilege to hear from the Commanding Officer of the ship, who will share insights from his extensive experience and leadership at sea. Additionally, officers with over 10 years of service will discuss the evolution of their careers and the unique challenges they have faced.

                        The broadcast will also feature female Agniveers, offering a perspective on the evolving role of women in the Navy and their inspiring journeys. This initiative aims to offer a rare glimpse into the lives of those who serve our nation at sea, highlighting their bravery, dedication, and the unique challenges they face. While many activities focus on marine conservation and beach clean-ups, this event seeks to recognize the ocean from the perspective of the Indian Navy. For Navy personnel, the ocean is more than just a habitat for marine life; it is their home and workplace, often for extended periods away from the comforts of urban life. Through interviews, testimonials, and public service announcements, "Mirchi on the Ocean" will shed light on the often-overlooked aspects of Navy life. Listeners will hear firsthand accounts of the challenges and rewards of serving on the high seas, aiming to inspire a deeper appreciation, and understanding of the Indian Navy’s vital role.
